-- Declaring this "gfx" shorthand will make your life easier. Instead of having
-- to preface all graphics calls with "playdate.graphics", just use "gfx."
-- Performance will be slightly enhanced, too.
-- NOTE: Because it's local, you'll have to do it in every .lua source file.

local gfx <const> = playdate.graphics



function calculator_setup()

  gfx.drawText("PlayDate Calculator", 10, 10)

end

-- Now we'll call the function above to configure our game.
-- After this runs (it just runs once), nearly everything will be
-- controlled by the OS calling `playdate.update()` 30 times a second.

calculator_setup()

-- `playdate.update()` is the heart of every Playdate game.
-- This function is called right before every frame is drawn onscreen.
-- Use this function to poll input, run game logic, and move sprites.

function playdate.update()

  playdate.timer.updateTimers()
